# IIITD Past Year Questions Repository

Welcome to the IIITD Past Year Questions (IIITD-PYQs) repository! 📚

## Introduction

This repository aims to gather past year examination papers from various courses offered at the Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology, Delhi (IIITD). It serves as a valuable resource for students to access and review previous years' questions, aiding in exam preparation.

## Motivation

The motivation behind this initiative is to address the challenge of finding past year questions easily. By consolidating and organizing past papers, we hope to create a centralized hub for students to access relevant materials conveniently. Additionally, this repository aims to establish a legacy of knowledge and facilitate collaborative learning.

## How to Contribute

I welcome contributions from students who are willing to share past year questions from additional courses. If you have taken a course and possess the past year papers, feel free to contribute by following these steps:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your contributions.
3. Add the past year papers in the appropriate directory (create a new directory if needed), please follow the naming convention(Course Code/Course Code + year) for example ADA directiory contains ADA 2023.
4. Commit your changes and submit a pull request.

Let's work together to build a comprehensive collection of past year questions!
Feel free to explore the existing directories and papers. If you cannot find a specific course, consider contributing to fill the gap!
